# Social Media Project

## About
A project i have been working on during my third semester at Noroff with focus on Bootstrap, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript. It is a social media platform for students and teachers at Noroff, using Noroff's own API database. During this project i have gained a deeper understanding of JS and leanred to split the code in modules and use imports and export to make it as DRY as possible.

During the first course, CSS frameworks, the assignment was to first build the design for the project homepage, profile page and login page using Bootstrap and SASS. We had to deliver the following cireterias:

- The homepage should have a feed of posts from the user’s contacts, a search bar, and a form to create a new post.
- The profile page should have a profile image, details about the user, a list of the user’s contacts, their posts and a form to post to their wall.
- The login page should have a form to login to the application. Ensure to include HTML form validation and use /profile as the action attribute.

We continued to work on this project when starting our Javascript 2 course, adding the functionality to the website.
